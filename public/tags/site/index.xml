      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been almost one and a half years since I last updated. I&amp;hellip; got no other excuse other than a LOT of stuff catching up to me. Basically a summary of what&amp;rsquo;s happened so far: a series of mental health issues, difficulty maintaining the blog with the kind of structure I have set up, falling behind on schoolwork, and, well, getting sucked into Final Fantasy XIV. It&amp;rsquo;s been &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; the ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also been rehauling my site in order to make a portfolio out of it! I&amp;rsquo;m quite excited about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Yoshi-p voice* Please look forward to it!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey guys! Things have been a little crazy&amp;ndash;thankfully, not as crazy as I expected. The workload is surprisingly manageable and not super stressful (&lt;em&gt;yet&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I already missed a couple astronomy classes but it&amp;rsquo;s not a very pressing issue at the moment. Both of my art professors are relatively lenient and enjoyable people, and I have the same art history professor from last year. My art history professor&amp;rsquo;s a particularly fun dude because his sense of humor and conversational lecturing makes class lively. (Though I unfortunately fall asleep during his lectures because I have him at &lt;em&gt;eight&lt;/em&gt; in the morning&amp;hellip; *groan*) Still, this semester&amp;rsquo;s going okay academically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been mostly just been watching kdramas (it&amp;rsquo;s in my Korean blood, okay) and anime shows with friends in my free time. Recently, I just finished up &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.crunchyroll.com/mob-psycho-100&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mob Psycho 100&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with a friend. &lt;em&gt;Mob Psycho 100&lt;/em&gt; is about a boy named Mob, who is an incredibly strong psychic, but he tries to suppress his powers in fear of hurting others. His teacher, Reigen, is a conman who pretends to be a psychic to earn money. And their relationship develops throughout the show and I cannot help but SCREAM about HOW LOVELY THESE TWO ARE?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://heroish.org/blog/img/screenshots/mob.png&#34; alt=&#34;Mob being cute&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
        This kid is too pure.
        
            
        
        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://heroish.org/blog/img/screenshots/reigen.png&#34; alt=&#34;Reigen being pure&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
        Despite the whole deception gag he&amp;#39;s got going on, Reigen is a good man.
        
            
        
        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://heroish.org/blog/img/screenshots/reigen-and-mob.png&#34; alt=&#34;Reigen and Mob&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
        UGH THEY&amp;#39;RE SO GOOD? THEY&amp;#39;RE BOTH SO GOOD.
        
            
        
        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Gosh I could go on and on and on about these two boys because they are good and pure but I&amp;rsquo;ll save that for another time&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there an anime or kdrama that you love?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;OKAY everything should be working now and hopefully there won&amp;rsquo;t be anymore surprises. Anyways, hello! My name&amp;rsquo;s Ree. I do all sorts of dumb stuff - like coding and drawing and gaming and writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a personal blog of mine so I&amp;rsquo;ll write about all sorts of things in my life like games, school (and art by association because I&amp;rsquo;m an art student), and writing. Yep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hoping that I&amp;rsquo;ll finally keep up with this blog! o/&lt;/p&gt;
