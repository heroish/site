<img src="img/dafuq_square.png" class="avatar" alt="avatar" /> >Hello! My name's Ree and I'm a college student studying Communication Arts. My favorite thing to do is getting lost in doing other stuff like: drawing, coding, writing, reading, gaming, and, as of late, making little tunes. I want to work at an animation or game studio someday, but I'm also perfectly content with making <del>memes</del> I mean, <del>puns</del> I MEAN, JOKES.

Some neato facts about myself:

- In both the Western and Chinese zodiacs, I'm an ox. So I'm twice as stubborn. \*badum tsh\*
- I love chocolate! And sweet stuff! But not too sweet or else I get a sugar rush.
- Along with wanting to work at an animation/game studio, I also want to write a novel  about adventures in a fantastical world. *And you can't stop me!*
- Sometimes I feel like I live in an Onion article.

*Will probably add some social links here later...*
