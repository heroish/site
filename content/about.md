<img src="/img/dafuq%20square.png" alt="avatar" class="avatar" /> Hello! My name's Lev and I'm a college student currently studying Communication Arts. My favorite thing to do is getting lost in doing other stuff like: drawing, coding, writing, reading, gaming, and, as of late, making little tunes. I want to work at an animation or game studio someday as a character concept artist.

The name of this blog, *Heroish*, came from many inspirations throughout life—they include superheroes, buddy cop shows, and fantasy adventures. My goal in life is to inspire others to do good or feel better about themselves. I blog about a range of topics but mostly about everyday life happenings. As both an artist and person, I hope that I can leave behind a positive impact on the world around me.

Some neato facts about myself:

- In both the Western and Chinese zodiacs, I'm an ox. So I'm twice as stubborn. \*badum tsh\*
- I love chocolate! And sweet stuff! But not too sweet or else I get a sugar rush.
- Astrology fascinates me on a psychological level—apparently I'm an ascendant Cancer and my moon sign is Pisces!  
- My sense of humor is laughing at the Knights of "Nee".
