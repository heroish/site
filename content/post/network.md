title: Thinking...
draft: true
---

I've been a bit busy over this spring break (aka, playing Dragon Age 2 and 7<sup>th</sup> Dragon â…¢ Code: VFD) and spending money like water on generally music and games. In any case, school's been relatively light on workload (suspiciously so... oh wait. Midterms. Oh *no*.) so I don't have a lot of academic stress to vent about thankfully.

What I *do* want to vent about it is the increasingly bipolar weather here. Absolutely awful. Just a week ago, it was warm enough to be summer. Now? It's like horrible version of winter where it rains instead of snows. And it's *really* cold rain that nobody likes. I had a hard time getting to class today because of all the wind and cold and overall gloomy atmosphere that's too familiar to this area.
