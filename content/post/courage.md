title: Courage Like Smoke
---

There are two words in Korean that are alike in sound:

courage and smoke.  
<u>용</u>기 (yong-gi) and <u>연</u>기 (yeon-gi).

<!--more-->

Courage quakes, chokes.  
Smoke shivers, quivers.

Yong-gi is bold, free--  
Yeon-gi is transient, absent.

The mighty sea  
it trembles, roars like fear.  
Yet the air  
it stumbles, soars like valor.

Courage is like smoke.

It vanishes if you try too hard.  
It clings if you stay still.  
It wavers if you have doubt.  
It settles if you stay and watch.

Smoke is like courage--

uncertain, beautiful, wavering  
just like you
and
I.
