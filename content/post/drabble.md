title: Slowly, Carefully
---

> Prompt: Kindness never helped anyone except for me. (Inspired by Gundam Unicorn's beautiful OST and BTS's Spring Day!)

<!--more-->

Yonggi clutches his umbrella close then slowly, carefully shifts it to shade the trembling human ball from lazy, drifting snowflakes.

"What are you doing there?" He asks.

The ball sniffles before peeking out from the shield of their arms.

"Huh?"

Yonggi's lips curl upward. "Who else am I talking to?"

He can see tinges of red bloom on the person's cheeks. It's kind of cute, he thinks, how a little joke flustered them like this. Yonggi shakes his head and holds out a gloved hand to the person.

"It's cold. C'mon, let's get you warm."

The person furrows their brow (combined with that pout, it's almost killer) and slowly, carefully takes Yonggi's proffered hand. With a grunt, he easily pulls them up on their feet. But he "accidentally" uses too much force. His umbrella slips from his grip and he stops the person from overbalancing by steadying their shoulders. The person seems even more flustered and tries to apologize, but Yonggi just shrugs and tells them "It's alright."

He picks up his fallen umbrella.

Yonggie glances back at the person, who stares back at him dumbfounded. This time, he can't resist raising an eyebrow and the amused twitch of his lips.

"Well? Don't you want to get out of this cold?"

"O-oh... right. Thank you."

The person hurries to catch up with Yonggi, who slows his steps to match the person's.

"Why are you being so nice to me?" The person asks.

Yonggi shrugs. "I wouldn't feel good about leaving a crying person out in the snow on my way back home." He flicks his gaze to the person. "Whoever made you cry is a jerk."

The person doesn't say anything and Yonggi leaves it at that. He turns his gaze to the road in front of him.

It feels forever has passed before he finally says, "We're here."

The two of them stand before a relatively small but nice looking apartment. It looks like a place that well-to-do, young, trendy people can afford. Yonggi doesn't look like he comes from a well-to-do family.

The question of *how* starts to bubble out of the person's mouth but Yonggi cuts them off with a decisive shrug and bland smile.

He swipes them in, nods his greetings to the security guard (who gives him a wink that he ignores), and leads his guest up three floors to a door at the end of a roomy hallway. Yonggi unlocks his door and holds it open for the person.

After a moment's hesitation, the person wades inside.

Yonggi closes and locks the door after him and kicks off his shoes while the person is neater, more careful with their boots.

"You can hang up your coat over there," Yonggi points to an old wooden coatrack in the corner of the cramped foyer. The person follows his instruction, still leaving on a thick, green scarf that's getting increasingly wet with melting snow.

"Your scarf too, if you want."

The person hangs up their sodden scarf too.

Yonggi directs his guest to sit at the dining table. He's a little weirded out by how well the guest listens to him. This whole situation is a little weird and more than a little awkward. He can feel the tension in the still air.

"I can make tea, coffee, and hot cocoa. What do you want?" He asks, busying himself in the tiny kitchen next to the dining room. Maybe the background noise will drown out the tension between them.

It takes a moment for the person to reply. "I'll have tea."

"I'm gonna make some black tea. Is that alright?"

"Fine by me."

"Okay."

Yonggi leaves the kettle boiling with water and takes a seat across from the person.

"I never got your name." He states, resting his elbows on the table and leaning his head into a curled hand. His voice is soft, crackles slightly like embers, and warm as a cozy fireplace when he speaks. "A bit rude of me in the first place, I guess. My name's Yonggi. What's yours?"

The person looks vaguely comfortable, but they seem reassured at Yonggi's relaxed posture. "I'm Remy. Nice to meet you, Yonggi."

Yonggi nods. That's the first time anyone's said his name correctly. "Nice to meet you too, Remy."

A moment of silence passes between them before Remy shyly breaks it. "U-uh... so, um... why did you...?"

"Like I said, I wouldn't feel good about leaving someone to cry in the cold like that. Your tears could've froze on your face."

Remy cringes a little. Yonggi softens in apology.

"The bathroom's down that way, second door to the right." He points out the way to illustrate his direction.

"Thank you."

Remy disappears into the bathroom. The tea kettle goes off seconds later.

Yonggi sighs, then goes to take the kettle off the heat.

He sets out two cups, pours steaming water, and lets the tea bags steep as he waits for Remy to return.

The tea has cooled considerably when Remy comes back out with slightly red eyes and nose.

Yonggi doesn't ask what's taken Remy so long, just takes his and Remy's cups to reheat them. It doesn't very long, and he returns to the table to serve the tea again.

"You okay?"

Remy sniffles and looks up at Yonggi with tears beginning to form in their eyes. Yonggi panics a little and wonders if he said anything wrong.

"Why are you being so nice to me?"

Yonggi shrugs, unsure of how else to reply. "Why can't I?"

Remy is quiet for a disturbing amount of time before they speak up again. "I... I don't have a lot of people. I don't have anyone, actually. I'm... kind of on my own."

Yonggi doesn't ask why or how.

"Do you still have a place to stay?"

Remy shakes their head.

"Then stay--"

"--with me."

Remy blinks up at a blank ceiling. Tears stain their cheeks. They hastily wipe them and turn their head to check on Yonggi. He's staring at Remy.

Their heartbeat speeds up a little.

"Y-Yonggi?"

He cups their cheek and scoots forward to wrap his legs around theirs. Remy relishes in the warmth, the closeness before Yonggi's gentle, crackly voice draws their attention. "You okay?"

Remy blushes and nods quickly. "Yeah. Yeah, don't worry about it."

"You were crying." Yonggi points out.

"Because I remembered the first time I met you," Remy replies, "and how grateful I was."

Yonggi raises an eyebrow. "And you aren't grateful now?"

Remy rolls their eyes and lightly smacks the side of Yonggi's arm. "Dummy."

"Hey, I'm *your* dummy, dummy."

"Don't call me a dummy, dummy." Remy chuckles and rolls on top of Yonggi, eyes twinkling with mischief. "Always be with me, Yonggi."

"I don't know about that--does that mean I'm supposed to follow you into the bathroom whenever you have to p--"

"No!" Remy can't help but laugh even more, rolling off of Yonggi in the process.
"You're gross. That's it, I'm not gonna sleep with you anymore."

"Nooo, then I'll complain to Vivi," Yonggi starts to explain with the most ridiculous pout on his face while Remy fights to suppress their laughs, "and then Vivi's gonna call me a baby and then I have to complain to Adri and Adri's gonna call me a baby too and then I'll complain to you and then *you're* gonna call me a baby."

"That's because you *are* a baby." Remy lightly flicks Yonggi's forehead and giggles at the silly face Yonggi makes in response.

Remy stops giggling when Yonggi circles his arms around their waist and pulls them close.

"Do you regret staying?" he asks quietly.

"No," Remy replies, "I don't."
