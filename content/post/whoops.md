title: Whoops...
---

It's been almost one and a half years since I last updated. I... got no other excuse other than a LOT of stuff catching up to me. Basically a summary of what's happened so far: a series of mental health issues, difficulty maintaining the blog with the kind of structure I have set up, falling behind on schoolwork, and, well, getting sucked into Final Fantasy XIV. It's been *quite* the ride.

I may or may not be planning to re-haul and make a Wordpress blog instead... Static site generators are pretty tedious to maintain.

\*Yoshi-p voice\* Please look forward to it!
